What is encapsulation?
    Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP).

What is inheritance?
    Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
    Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
    Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

What is multiple inheritance?
    When a class is derived from more than one base class it is called multiple Inheritance.
    The derived class inherits all the features of the base case.

What is polymorphism?
    Polymorphism is often used in Class methods, where we can have multiple classes with the same method name

What is method resolution order or MRO?
The Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the set of rules that construct the linearization.
In the Python literature, the idiom "the MRO of C" is also used as a synonymous for the linearization of the class C.
